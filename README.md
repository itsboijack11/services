this is a simple app for adding your passwords in a safe/secure place

#Instructions
To use the app download the .exe file. You do not need to open with administrator the default email and password is admin@gmail.com and admin. to change the email there is a change credentials screen. Also this was originally for a raspidude login so thats why you see server port and ect. Hope this helps, have fun!!
